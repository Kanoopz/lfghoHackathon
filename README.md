"./yieldGhoVault" project for lfghoHackathon.


We utilized Aave's pools to supply WETH and generate yield from it. Aave's credit delegation allows investors to make off-chain legal agreements to also gain yield from their borrowing power. A vault is used to design strategies and serves as a facilitator to manage the issuance of GHO, calculating the correct peg and its ratio. Account abstraction is employed to create a mailWallet to onboard Web2 investors, and CCIP's cross-chain infrastructure enables people to invest in other chains' DeFi protocols with the GHO stablecoin.
